# Suppression-of-sawtooth-oscillations
The program calculates the hydrodynamics in a liquid droplet evaporating on a substrate and containing a suspended or dissolved substance based on the lubrication approximation. The finite difference method is used here. The problem of sawtooth oscillations has been solved.
