The program calculates the capillary hydrodynamics in a liquid droplet evaporating
on a substrate and containing a suspended or dissolved substance
based on the lubrication approximation. The finite difference method is
used here. The problem of sawtooth oscillations has been solved.

for mass transfer simulation via the lubrication approximation in a droplet evaporated on a substrate.

Version 7
Checking of the  mass conservation law has been added.
